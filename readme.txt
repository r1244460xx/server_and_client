Q: How to run my program?
A: Just enter the current path including the server.py.
Using DOS cmd and enter "python server.py", then it would run and waiting for a connection from a client.
If the connection is built, the server program would be closed. 
So if you run to activate again, you need to enter the same command again. 
I am mean to run it once per activation.
Besides, I programmed a simple website "hello.html" for demo and test.
After you run the server.py, you are able to run your browser for testing.
Enter the url "localhost/hello.html", then the content of "hello.html" would show on the browser.
You could use F12 to check the http header made by me. The header would show my own server name.
You may also use wrong url like "localhost/hello1.html". 
It would return the "404 Not Found" message on screen.
